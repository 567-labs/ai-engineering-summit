    "# Notebook 1: Systematically Improving Your RAG Application\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** : This notebook is a preview of what we cover in [improvingrag.com](https://improvingrag.com). Stop settling for \"Looks Good to Me\" and start building better systems. Learn how to turn RAG from a risky experiment into a structured, data-driven practice. Check out [improvingrag.com](https://improvingrag.com) for a proven foundational framework to help you go beyond the basics to improve performance, quality, and user experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll learn why focusing solely on the generation step can be costly and slow down improvements, and how optimizing the retrieval process can lead to faster, more effective iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "When developers build RAG applications, they often focus on the generation step. This is an expensive choice and prevents them from iterating fast and improving the quality of their application. Without a clear systematic approach in mind, it's hard to know how generic advice to use a specific re-ranker or embedding model actually translates to improvements in retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What you'll learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding RAG's Importance\n",
    "- Explore how large language models struggle without the proper context.\n",
    "- Learn why adding relevant context through methods like vector search is critical for effective retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Where Semantic Search Falls Short\n",
    "- Identify common failure modes when relying only on semantic search.\n",
    "- Understand how metadata filters can enhance search results and why cosine similarity may miss key nuances in queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Embracing a Systematic Approach\n",
    "- Discover the value of quantifying the impact of each component in your RAG pipeline.\n",
    "- See why starting with retrieval evaluation can lead to faster, more cost-effective improvements and higher user satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll have a clear understanding of why a systematic approach to building RAG applications is key to building any high quality RAG application and how starting with retrieval evaluation leads to faster, cheaper iteration."

    "## What is RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique whereby we inject some information into the prompt of a language model so that it can use it to answer a question about information that it wasn't trained on. This is crucial for helping to adapt language models to specific domains and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Context Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models often have a fixed knowledge cut off date and do not have access to any private information on your specific domain. Imagine we're building a RAG application to answer questions about a clothing store - without any context, the model will not know the price or other details of any specific item in your catalog.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's see an example below where we ask a language model to answer a question about the price of a fictional item in our catalog called AX123 which has a price of $49.99 and is in stock at the moment."

    "## Why A Systematic Approach Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a structured approach to building our RAG applications because it provides us with\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A clear way to evaluate different technologies and techniques\n",
    "2. A decision making process that allows us to prioritise different components of our pipeline\n",
    "3. A methodology to diagnose and improve application performance\n",
    "4. A set of standardized metrics and benchmarks to measure success\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, with a systematic approach, we can waste less time guessing about whether something works or not and instead use objective metrics to guide our decisions. This ensures that we can quantify and know the impact of each component in our pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real goal here is that instead of \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Being told to make the AI better\n",
    "2. Not knowing what to do when they say look at the data\n",
    "3. Having no idea what features to prioritise \n",
    "\n",
    "We can instead\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify key metrics that we can track to determine what's working and what's not\n",
    "2. Segment customer queries to understand what development efforts to prioritise\n",
    "3. Generate and bootstrap evaluation datasets to test the impact of different components of our pipeline so we know what exactly works for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, your only job here is to make sure that you're applying consistent effort and the same system to achieve the boring success that you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Starting with Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're an engineer working on a RAG application, you're probably focusing on generation. We've already seen how just relying on semantic search alone fails to retrieve the right items in certain cases, so why not focus on retrieval first?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we think about it carefully: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Without the right context, the generation step is essentially useless\n",
    "2. We're missing out on major big wins that we could get just from improving retrieval alone\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick breakdown of the tradeoffs between evaluating generation and retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Content Generation | Retrieval Metrics |\n",
    "|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| Speed | 1-10s per test | 10-800ms per test |\n",
    "| Cost | $100s per run | Negligible |\n",
    "| Objectivity | Subjective | Quantitative |\n",
    "| Iteration Speed | Hours | Minutes |\n",
    "| Scale | Limited | Automated |\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Retrieval is not only multi-step, but also multi-index​. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](./assets/rag.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without clearly understanding the impact of each component in our retrieval pipeline, we're essentially flying blind and hoping for the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "With models having stronger reasoning ability and longer context windows, it's important to make sure that we nail our retrieval by making sure that we can consistently retrieve the right context for our model. This is an incredibly important step that is often overlooked."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we've explored why building effective RAG applications requires a systematic approach rather than just implementing semantic search. Through hands-on examples with our e-commerce dataset, we saw how even simple queries - like finding matching items, filtering by price, or checking stock levels - quickly expose the limitations of pure semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "These challenges highlight two key insights:\n",
    "1. Simply retrieving semantically similar text often misses important details and constraints\n",
    "2. Metadata filtering and structured data are crucial for handling real-world queries effectively\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll put some of these principles in practice in the next notebook where we'll explore how to evaluate our retrieval pipeline. We'll walk through some key metrics that we can use to evaluate our retrieval pipeline, show how we can use synthetic queries to compute an initial baseline before benchmarking how techniques like better item descriptions impact performance.\n",
